This contains all necessary data files, evaluation and graphing scripts for the submission of Cell-specific 
Imputation of Drug Connectivity Mapping with Incomplete Data. Details about each folder can be found below

Data: 
       Contains complete data matrix (12 cells by 450 drugs) and sparse data matrix (80 cells by 1330 drugs).
Mkdataset.R produces the matrices, mkfold.R and mkfold_sparse.R generate the cross-validation sets. 
Fold assignments used included for each independent instance. Install rhdf5 and cmapR libraries to run. 
       Within the 80x1330 folder there are the completely imputed sparse matrices described in sections 2.5.2,
 3.4 and the hybrid version of the sparse matrix described in section 3.5, as well as scripts within each 
subfolder for building the data sets.

Evaluation:
	Imputation contains scripts for baseline and collaborative filtering prediction and negative and 
positive weighted connectivity correlation (sections 2.3, 2.4.2, 3.1). Install rrecsys package to run.
	Downsample contains scripts for randomly removing compounds from folds, re-imputing and re-evaluating
signatures to predict with less data (section 3.2).
       Pcl_eval contains scripts for querying a drug against the true or completely imputed sparse matrix, 
adapting gene set enrichment analysis as drug set enrichment analysis, analyzing the number of drugs 
significantly enriched in their PCL, and input files such as PCL membership for determining drug intersection
between data sets and PCLs (sections 2.5, 3.3, and 3.4).

Analysis: 
       Contains scripts used for graphing and example of input files. The corresponding figure numbers are 
part of the folder name. Packages required: ggplot2, corrplot, ggpubr.
